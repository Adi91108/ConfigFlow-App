# Configure Flow UI Clone

This project is a UI implementation similar to the "Configure Flow" feature, built using Create React App. It includes a dynamic visual representation of a process flow, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with React Icons for better iconography. The UI ensures a pixel-perfect design while rendering data from a mock API.

# 🚀 Tech Stack

React.js (Create React App)

Tailwind CSS (Styling)

React Icons (Icons)

Mock API (Dynamic Data Rendering)

# 🎯 Features

Flow Visual Representation: A structured UI showcasing process flow.

Directional Arrows: Arrows indicate the movement direction within the flow.

Custom Card Component: Displays data retrieved from a mock API.

Pixel-Perfect UI Design: Focused on precise spacing, alignment, and styling.

Dynamic Data Rendering: API-driven content updates dynamically within the UI.

# 🛠️ Challenges Faced

Rendering Flow Arrows Inside the Grid: Positioning the arrows correctly within the structured layout was tricky. Ensuring proper alignment required fine-tuning CSS properties and utilizing flex/grid layouts efficiently.

Ensuring Smooth UI Interaction: Keeping the UI responsive and ensuring dynamic rendering without layout shifts.
