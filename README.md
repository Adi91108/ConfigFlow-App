Configure Flow UI Clone

This project is a UI implementation similar to the "Configure Flow" feature, built using Create React App. It includes a dynamic visual representation of a process flow, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with React Icons for better iconography. The UI ensures a pixel-perfect design while rendering data from a mock API.

🚀 Tech Stack

React.js (Create React App)
